Description:

This is a set of five games, which can test your logical skills:
1. Choose "Brain-even" to define is the represented number even or not.
2. If you want to practice you skills in math, you can choose "brain-calc".
3. I have no words to describe how simple is "brain-prime".
4. Let's try to find one piece of given progression in "brain-progression".
5. And the last, but not the least "brain-gcd", if you want to strain your brain as much as possible.

Three correct answers in a row will lead to victory. Making one mistake will provide losing.

You can see how it works in video below
